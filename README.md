# WebGLDomInteraction

An example of how the DOM can be used to influence a WEBGL render.
The example is also programmed to use a software renderer as a fallback to webgl and hardware accelleration. 
The two libraries CanvasRenderer and Projector achieve this. There is also some minimal logic in the webgl controller to apply its use.

# Get Started

Simply open index.html and drag drop the shapes onto the render area. (Does not need to be served).

# Why?

Back in 2016 a project my workplace was working on needed to be sure that we could use DOM elements on a webpage to influcence the a WebGL render that used three.js. 
Therefore I created this project. It has been sat on my HDD since then so archiving on Github.
